/**
 * Processes Runnable objects sequentially on a pool of processor threads.
 * The order in which the runnable objects are processed is
 * the same in which they were added to the dispatcher.
 * <p>
 * Per default, there is one pool per VM running 5 threads. You can
 * assign the dispatcher to a different thread pool using the constructor
 * or using method <code>setThreadPool</code>.
 * <p>
 * The static method <code>dispatchConcurrently</code> enqueues the
 * runnable object for concurrent execution. That is, it will be
 * processed as soon as one of the pooled threads becomes available.
 * <p>
 * The instance method <code>dispatch</code> enqueues
 * the runnable object for sequential execution. It will be processed
 * by one of the pooled threads when all of the preceedingly enqueued
 * runnables have been processed. There is one queue per instance.
 * <p>
 * Design pattern used: Acceptor
 * Role in design pattern: EventCollector and EventProcessor
 * <p>
 * <b>Example 1</b>
 * <br>The following program prints "one", "two", "three" on
 * concurrent processor threads:
 * <pre>
 * PooledSequentialDispatcher.dispatchConcurrently(
 *     new Runnable(public void run() { System.out.println("one"); });
 * );
 * PooledSequentialDispatcher.dispatchConcurrently(
 *     new Runnable(public void run() { System.out.println("two"); });
 * );
 * PooledSequentialDispatcher.dispatchConcurrently(
 *     new Runnable(public void run() { System.out.println("three"); });
 * );
 * </pre>
 * The order of the output is not granted, since the runnables are
 * executed concurrently. It could be "one","two","three" or "three","one","two"
 * or any other possible combination. Even intermingled output is possible.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Example 2</b>
 * <br>The following program prints "one", "two", "three" on
 * sequential processor threads:
 * <pre>
 * PooledSequentialDispatcher dispatcher = new PooledSequentialDispatcher();
 *
 * dispatcher.dispatch(
 *     new Runnable(public void run() { System.out.println("one"); });
 * );
 * dispatcher.dispatch(
 *     new Runnable(public void run() { System.out.println("two"); });
 * );
 * dispatcher.dispatch(
 *     new Runnable(public void run() { System.out.println("three"); });
 * );
 * </pre>
 * Since all runnables are dispatched by the same PoolDispatcherAWT instance,
 * it is granted, that they will be executed in the same order as they were
 * added to the queue. It is also granted, that the output will not be
 * intermingled, because a runnable will be executed only, when its predecessor
 * has finished.
