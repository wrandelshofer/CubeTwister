 * Processes Runnable objects concurrently on a pool of processor threads.

 * There is one thread pool per instance.
 * <p>
 * Design pattern used: Acceptor
 * Role in design pattern: EventCollector and EventProcessor
 * <p>
 * <b>Example</b>
 * <br>The following program prints "Hello World" on the
 * processor thread:
 * <pre>
 * // Create the Dispatcher.
 * ConcurrentDispatcher dispatcher = new ConcurrentDispatcher();
 *
 * // Create the Runnable object.
 * Runnable runner = new Runnable() {

 *         System.out.println("Hello World");

 * };
 *
 * // Execute the Runnable objekt using the dispatcher.
 * dispatcher.dispatch(runner);
