     * N Choose M - Compute the number of ways a subset of N items can
     * be selected from a set of M items.  N must be greater than M.
     * The formula for N choose M is:
     *   N! / (M! * (N-M)!)
     *
     * The N! / (N-M)! portion can be computed iteratively as:
     *   N * (N-1) * (N-2) * (N-3) * ... * (N-M+1)
     *
     * The M! portion can be divided out iteratively as:
     *   1, 2, 3 ... M
     * (i.e. first divide partial result by 1, then by 2, then by 3,...)
     *
     * Note that both require M iterations allowing the entire
     * calculation to be performed within a single loop.  Note also
     * that we want to keep the numerator as large as possible during
     * this calculation to avoid truncation error during the division.
     * This is accomplished by performing the multiplication in
     * descending order and the division in ascending order.
     *
     * Since N choose M is equivalent to N choose (N-M) we can take
     * advantage of this property to optimize the calculation in
     * cases where M &gt; N/2 since using the equivalent form results
     * in a smaller M recalling that M is the number of loop iterations.
     *
     * Note, the performance of this function could be improved by
     * using a table of precomputed results (i.e. NChooseM[N][M]).

     * largest, second largest, third largest, etc. elements in
     * the permutation vector.  Each time it finds the ith largest
     * element, it exchanges that with the element at location i.
     * Thus there are i possibilities for the position of the ith
     * largest element. This process yields the i coefficients.
