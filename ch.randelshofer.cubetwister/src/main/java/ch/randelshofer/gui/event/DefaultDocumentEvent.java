     * Gets the change information for the given element.

     * no changes, null is returned.
     * <p>
     * This method is for observers to discover the structural
     * changes that were made.  This means that only elements
     * that existed prior to the mutation (and still exist after
     * the mutatino) need to have ElementChange records.
     * The changes made available need not be recursive.
     * <p>
     * For example, if the an element is removed from it's
     * parent, this method should report that the parent
     * changed and provide an ElementChange implementation
     * that describes the change to the parent.  If the
     * child element removed had children, these elements
     * do not need to be reported as removed.
     * <p>
     * If an child element is insert into a parent element,
     * the parent element should report a change.  If the
     * child element also had elements inserted into it
     * (grandchildren to the parent) these elements need
     * not report change.
